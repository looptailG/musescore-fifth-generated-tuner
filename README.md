# Fifth Generated Tuner
A plugin for Musescore for tuning a score according to the specified fifth size.

Based on [this plugin](https://musescore.org/en/project/fifths-based-tuning), and updated to work with Musescore4.

## Features
This plugin can be used to tune the whole score, or only a portion of it, to a [linear temperament](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Linear_temperament) generated by the specified fifth size.

The plugin provides the fifth sizes of some commonly used tuning system, but you can input whatever size you prefer.

## Usage

- Choose one of the preset fifth sizes, or enter your own value.
- Click `Tune`.
