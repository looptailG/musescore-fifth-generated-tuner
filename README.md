# Fifth Generated Tuner
A plugin for Musescore for tuning a score according to the specified fifth size.

Based on [this plugin](https://musescore.org/en/project/fifths-based-tuning), and updated to work with Musescore4.

## Features
This plugin can be used to tune the whole score, or only a portion of it, to a [linear temperament](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Linear_temperament) generated by the specified fifth size.
The plugin provides the fifth sizes of some commonly used tuning system, but you can input whatever size you prefer.

Only sizes between `685.7 ¢` and `720.0 ¢` produce results that [make sense](https://en.xen.wiki/w/Diatonic_range) according to standard notation.
For fifths outside this range the plugin will work anyway, but it could produce some counterintuitive results.

## Usage
- If you want to tune only a portion of the score, select it before running the plugin. If nothing is selected, the entire score will be tuned.
- Launch the plugin: `Plugins` → `Playback` → `Fifth Generated Tuner`.
- Choose one of the preset fifth sizes, or enter your own value.
- Click `Tune`.
